# cordova-plugin-app-center

DEPRECATION NOTICE:
===================
Microsoft has released their own plugin and it's much better than mine and also it's official, so use theirs instead of mine:
https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter-sdk-cordova



Plugin to initialize App Center in your Cordova app

Install the plugin
```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-app-center
```

And add you app secret in the config.xml
```
<preference name="AppCenterSecret" value="yourAppSecret" />
```
